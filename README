- These files are designed to be run in a Unix/Linux environment

- From the commandline, compile from the same directory as this file using command:
	javac *.java

- Run Key_setup using command:
	java Key_setup

- Run Encryption using command:
	java Encryption

- Run Decryption using command:
	java Decryption

- General Notes:
   - All programs are to be run with no arguments.

   - To ensure proper execution, program run order should be:
     Key_setup -> Encryption -> Decryption

   - Key_setup has no prerequisite files
	- Runtime is a little slow because I've chosen p and q to be 250 digits each

   - Encryption relies on existance of:
	- public_key
	- message

   - Decryption relies on existence of:
	- public_key
	- private_key
	- ciphertext
